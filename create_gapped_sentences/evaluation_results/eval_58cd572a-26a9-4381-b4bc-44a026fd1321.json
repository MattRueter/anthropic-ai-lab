      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed for A2 level with formal register. 'Playing' correctly uses morphology (present participle) and fits naturally in the sentence. 'Friends' correctly uses the plural form, also valid with morphology=true. Sentences are clear, contextually appropriate, and the gaps are unambiguous. Slight deduction as 'The children are _____ in the park' is slightly informal in tone, though still acceptable for A2."

      "comment": "Both sentences are well-crafted at B2 level with an informal register. 'Establish' is correctly used in its base form in a natural context about freelancing. 'Brave' is used as an adjective in its base form in a relatable social situation. Morphology constraint (false) is respected in both cases, using the exact words provided. The sentences are engaging and contextually appropriate. Minor deduction as 'establish yourself' is slightly more advanced phrasing, but still fits B2 well."
