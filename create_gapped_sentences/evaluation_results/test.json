      "comment": "The sentences are well-crafted for A2 level with an informal register. All three sentences use natural, conversational language appropriate for the level. Morphology is correctly applied: 'playing' (present participle), 'friends' (plural noun), and 'called' (past tense) are all valid morphological variations since morphology is set to true. The gaps are clear and unambiguous. Minor deduction: 'Me and my friends' is grammatically incorrect (should be 'My friends and I'), but since the register is informal, this colloquial usage could be considered acceptable. Overall, excellent exercise design."

      "comment": "The sentences are well-constructed and appropriate for B2 level with a formal register. All three words are used in their base form as required by morphology:false. 'establish', 'policy', and 'increase' are correctly gapped and fit naturally in context. The sentences are clear and unambiguous, making them suitable for gap-fill exercises. Minor deduction as 'increase' could theoretically fit other words like 'boost' or 'raise', making it slightly less precise as a gap-fill item."
