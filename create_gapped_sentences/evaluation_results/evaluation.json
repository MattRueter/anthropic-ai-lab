      "comment": "The sentences are well-constructed for A2 level and use a formal register appropriately. Morphology is set to true, so 'playing', 'friends', and 'called' are all valid morphological variations. The gaps are clear and contextually meaningful. Minor note: 'The children are _____ in the park' is slightly informal in context, but the structure is grammatically sound. Overall, excellent quality sentences that test vocabulary in context."

      "comment": "All three sentences are well-constructed for B2 level with an informal register. The gapped sentences use the base form of each word as required by morphology:false. 'Establish' fits naturally in a conversational context about setting rules. 'Brave' is used as an adjective in a natural informal construction. 'Increase' is used as an infinitive in practical advice-giving context. The sentences are appropriately informal with colloquial touches like 'gonna get messy' and 'you should probably'. Minor deduction as the sentences could push slightly more toward genuinely informal/colloquial language, but overall excellent execution."
