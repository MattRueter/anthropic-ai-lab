      "comment": "The sentences are well-constructed for A2 level with a formal register. Morphology is correctly applied: 'playing' (present participle), 'friends' (plural), and 'called' (past tense) are all valid morphological variations. The gaps are clear and contextually appropriate. Minor note: 'The children are _____ in the park after school today' is slightly informal in tone, but overall the sentences meet the requirements well."

      "comment": "Excellent response overall. All three sentences are well-suited to B2 level and use an informal register naturally. Morphology is correctly respected: 'establish', 'brave', and 'increase' are all used in their base forms without any inflection. The gaps are clearly positioned and the sentences provide sufficient context for learners to identify the correct word. Minor deduction because 'brave' as an adjective in its base form is straightforward, leaving little ambiguity or challenge for a B2 learner, but it remains appropriate and correct."
