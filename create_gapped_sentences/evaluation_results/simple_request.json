      "comment": "The sentences are well-constructed for A2 level and use a formal register appropriately. Morphology is correctly applied: 'playing' (present participle), 'friends' (plural), and 'called' (past tense) are all valid morphological variations. The gaps are clear and contextually meaningful. Minor note: 'The children are _____ in the park after school today' is slightly informal in tone, but overall the sentences meet the requirements well."

      "comment": "The sentences are well-crafted for B2 level with an informal register. All three words are used in their base form as required by morphology=false. 'Establish' fits naturally in the trust context, 'brave' works as an adjective correctly, and 'increase' is used appropriately as a verb. The sentences are engaging and contextually natural for informal speech. Minor deduction as 'establish' in an informal context could feel slightly formal, though it is acceptable at B2 level."
