      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed for A2 level with a formal register. 'Playing' correctly uses morphology (present participle) and 'friends' correctly uses morphology (plural noun). The sentences are clear, contextually appropriate, and the gaps are well-placed. Minor note: the first sentence could be slightly more formal, but overall both sentences meet the requirements effectively."

      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed at B2 level with an informal register. 'Establish' is correctly used in base form in a gap-fill context where 'establish' is the natural answer (infinitive after 'to'). 'Brave' is used as an adjective in its original form. Morphology is respected — no inflected forms are required. The sentences are natural, contextually appropriate, and informal in tone. Minor deduction: the 'establish' sentence could theoretically accept 'established' if misread, but the 'to _____' structure makes the base form unambiguous."
