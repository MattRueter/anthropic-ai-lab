      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed for A2 level with formal register. 'Playing' correctly uses morphology (present participle) and fits naturally in the sentence. 'Friends' correctly uses the plural form with morphology allowed. Sentences are clear, contextually appropriate, and the gaps are unambiguous. Slight deduction as 'The children are _____ in the park after school today' is slightly informal in tone, though still acceptable."

      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed for B2 level with an informal register. 'Establish' is correctly used in its base form in a natural informal context about freelancing. 'Brave' is correctly used as an adjective in its base form. Morphology rules are respected as both words appear in their original uninflected forms. The gaps are clear and unambiguous. Minor deduction because 'establish yourself' slightly nudges toward a reflexive construction that could hint at the answer, but overall both sentences are excellent gap-fill exercises."
