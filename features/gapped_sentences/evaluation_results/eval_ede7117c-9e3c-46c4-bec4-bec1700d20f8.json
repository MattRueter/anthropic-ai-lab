      "comment": "Both sentences are appropriate for A2 level and use a formal register. Morphology is set to true, so 'playing' (present participle) and 'friends' (plural) are valid transformations. The sentences are clear and contextually appropriate. Minor note: 'The children are playing in the park' is slightly informal, but overall the sentences meet the requirements well."

      "comment": "Both sentences are well-constructed for B2 level with an informal register. 'Establish' is correctly used in its base form in a natural context about routines. 'Brave' is correctly used as an adjective in an informal, relatable context about skydiving. Morphology is respected as both words appear in their original uninflected forms. The sentences are clear, contextually appropriate, and the gaps are unambiguous. Minor deduction as the sentences are somewhat predictable, but overall excellent quality."
