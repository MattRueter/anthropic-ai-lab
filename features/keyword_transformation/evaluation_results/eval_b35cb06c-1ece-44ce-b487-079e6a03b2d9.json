      "comment": "The exercises are mostly good and test different uses of 'think/thought' well. The sentences vary nicely in structure (active, passive, past perfect). However, sentence 5 is problematic: 'reconsidered' doesn't naturally transform to a 'thought' construction (e.g., 'thought again about' is awkward). Sentence 1 is straightforward and clear. Overall, a solid set with minor issues in creativity and one questionable transformation."
